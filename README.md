For a piece of assessed coursework, during my Mathematics Degree at the University of Nottingham, I was required to make a model to predict whether a baby would be healthy.

In this report, we will be analysing 327 observations of newborn babies and investigating which variables affect birth weight most significantly. The data was then used to identify the relationships between the variables and to create a linear model that predicts the birth weight. The most influential variables were the gestation period and the mother's weight; others were required in the model but were less significant.

Skills Developed:

- Analysing different variables to deduct which would be the most appropriate to include in the linear model and ensuring little colinearity.
- Manipulating specific variables to reduce the amount of skew present, ensuring that it is more representative of the data.
- Use a variety of techniques to find the optimal model.
- Testing the model on a sample data set to ensure there is no overfitting and to find the accuracy.
